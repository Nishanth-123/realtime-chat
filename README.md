# React time chatting

This app enables us to create a chat room or join an existing room with an id.

## Steps to run locally

- You can run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies.
- You can run `npm run dev` in the root directory after installing dependencies. That's it. You can access the app at `localhost:5173`.
- You can create a room in one browser context and join the created room with the room ID in a different browser context as a different user to witness the working of the app.
